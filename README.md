Welcome to the Techstore management system! Here I have created a simillar system to a normal tech website. You can run the Start.java file to start the programme. In this  program you can explore the products like desktops, laptops, smartphones etc and you don't need to login form the start. So if you like any product you can just press 'add to cart' then click on 'user account' to login and view the products and press on confirm purchase to goto purchase methods and see the total prices and you can also romove the orders. This porgram can remember the last logged account even if it's closed. So don't forget to Logout from UserPage before closing
